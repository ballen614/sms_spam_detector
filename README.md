# OSU AI Bootcamp - Module 21 Challenge - SMS Text Classification
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
In this challenge, I'll be refactoring code from an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Once the model is created and trained, I will create a Gradio app to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.
## Files
- gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb is the main homework file where my code was added.
- Resources/SMSSpamCollection.csv is the data used to train the model.
- sms_text_classification_solution.ipynb was a documented provided for reference.

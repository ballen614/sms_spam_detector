# OSU AI Bootcamp - Challenge 5 - Athletic Sales Analysis
## Submitted by Brandon Allen
## Overview
The task was to complete a jupyter notebook, exploring a data set containing sales data.  The goal was to follow the requests of the assignment, which involved merging two years worth of data, checking for opportunities to clean (null values) and then assessing different aspects of revenue, mostly around region and later by product as well.  Overall this assignment was a good reminder of the Pandas groupby and pivot_table methods.
## Files
- athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code.ipynb is the main file where the assignment is completed.
- athletic_sales_2020.csv and athletic_sales_2021.csv are the data sources for the assignment.
